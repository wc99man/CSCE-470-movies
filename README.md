# CSCE-470-movies
The data set for our project was found here https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/ We are using title.akas.tsv.gz, title.basics.tsv.gz, title.crew.tsv.gz, title.principals.tsv.gz, title.ratings.tsv.gz, name.basics.tsv.gz.

We currently plan on using an altered version of KNN classification system to provide movie recommendations.

The strong features are: Title, Genre

The weak features are: Startyear, Runtime, Ratings

We hope to eventually include directors, writers, and actors, but those are a bit harder for use to parse through currently.
